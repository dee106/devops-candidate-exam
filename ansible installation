How to configure Ansible and SSH connection between nodes ?
> Launch 3 EC2 instances and make one server for ansible server and another 2 are node server
> yum update -y
> then install epel package
yum install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm --skip-broken
> yum update -y

put both private IP's of nodes
** you need enable default configuration**
> vi ansible.cfg
 uncomment inventory path and sudo_user
and save
> we create ansible user on ansible server and 2 nodes by using useradd and passwd
> have to give sudoers permissions
go to /etc/sudoers
vi sudoers
ansible ALL=[ALL] NOPASSWD: ALL
do above steps in all servers and login through root user
**SSH configuration
go into root login then 
cd /etc/ssh
vi sshd_config
uncommit permitrootlogin
uncommit PasswordAuthentication yes
commit PasswordAuthentication no
then service sshd restart
do this for all servers
now you can jump on to the node
> ssh 172.31.92.215
> ssh 172.31.89.29
but it will ask password
----------------------------------------
ssh trusted relation
go to the ansible server
login with ansible user
give command ssh-keygen
cd .ssh/
ls
> ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.92.215
> ssh-copy-id ansible@172.31.89.29
> ssh 172.31.92.215
> ssh 172.31.89.29
when you jump to node server it will not ask you abt password
